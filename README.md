# RAS_Image_Powerpoint_Generator
I had around 100 images in six treatment groups that I wanted to be able to create a powerpoint presentation with one image from each treatment group in order to be able to visually inspect and compare. I found a cool python library called pptx that allowed me to manipulate powerpoint files directly from the code, and therefore, this small script created the presentation I wanted, greatly speeding up the process compared to if I had to manually create all of the slides myself.
